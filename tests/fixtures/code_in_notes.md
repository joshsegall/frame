# Code Notes Track

## Backlog

- [ ] `CN-001` Task with code in notes
  - note:
    Here is some example code:
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        // This is a task line inside code: - [ ] Not a task
        println!("- [x] Also not a task");
    }
    ```
    And some more text after the code block.
- [ ] `CN-002` Task with multiple code blocks
  - note:
    First block:
    ```python
    def foo():
        return 42
    ```

    Second block:
    ```
    plain code
    - [ ] still not a task
    ```
    End of note.
- [ ] `CN-003` Simple task after code notes
